## Questions for the showcase on the 22nd of February 2024:
1)	How many small dams and reservoirs are located within the crown land? 
2)	Can you identify all parcels on which one or more new farm dams or reservoirs have been developed in last year?
3)	How many of properties has been flooded in last 5 years?
4)	How many dams and reservoirs have increased in their size in last 5 years?
